# Sigiri - Uniform Resource Abstraction for Girds and Clouds

With the maturation of Grid computing facilities and recent explosion of cloud computing data centers, mid-scale computational science has more options than ever before to satisfy computational needs. But heterogeneity brings complexity. We propose a simple abstraction for interaction with heterogeneous resource managers spanning grid and cloud computing, and on features that make the tool useful for the mid-scale physical or natural scientist. Key strengths of the abstraction are its support for multiple standard job specification languages, preservation of direct user interaction with the service, removing the delay that can come through layers of services, and the predictable behaviour under heavy loads.

# About this version
This is a new version Sigiri framework target specially at Windows Azure
based computing resources. This is currently under active development.
Features of the older version will be mibgrated new architecture soon.
