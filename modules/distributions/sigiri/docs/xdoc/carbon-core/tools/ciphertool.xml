<h1>ciphertool - Utiliy to encrypt and decrypt simple texts</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a simple tool to encrypt and decrypt simple texts.There are scripts
named ciphertool.sh &amp; ciphertool.bat available in the bin directory to launch the tool. The arguments
accepted by this tool with their meanings are shown bellow. </p>

<ul>
    <li>keystore - If keys are in a store , its location </li>
    <li>storepass - Password to access keyStore </li>
    <li>keypass - To get private key </li>
    <li>alias - Alias to identify key owner </li>
    <li>storetype - Type of keyStore, Default is JKS </li>
    <li>keyfile - If key is in a file </li>
    <li>opmode - encrypt or decrypt , Default is encrypt </li>
    <li>algorithm - encrypt or decrypt algorithm , Default is RSA </li>
    <li>source - Either cipher or plain text as an in-lined form </li>
    <li>outencode - Currently base64 and used for encoding the result</li>
    <li>inencode - Currently base64 and used to decode input </li>
    <li>trusted - Is KeyStore a trusted store? If this argument is provided, consider as a trusted store </li>
    <li>passphrase - if a simple symmetric encryption using a pass phrase shall be used </li>
</ul>
    
<p>An example </p>

<pre>ciphertool.bat -source testpass -keystore resources/security/client-truststore.jks -storepass wso2carbon -alias wo2carbon -outencode base64 -trusted</pre>
